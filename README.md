## Project to classify images as containing fire or not containing fire

### About:
  - Due to a changing climate, the risk of fire during the Summer season is a legitimate concern.  
  - It is important to have the ability to identify images of fire using machine learning.  
  - This is the first implementation of a larger project to identify videos with fire and, even further, identify locations that are at high risk.  
  - Early identification/detection of such locations can help prevent and reduce the damage caused by fires.  

### The dataset contains 755 fire images and 244 non-fire images.
  - Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset
